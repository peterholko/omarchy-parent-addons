# The web filter of a child install (plans/kids-dns.md), reached as
# `omarchy-parent dns ...`. dnsmasq answers on 127.0.0.1 from the parent's
# lists, behind systemd-resolved; NetworkManager keeps its own servers to
# itself; the firewall closes the ways around it; the browsers are told not
# to bring their own resolver. Disabled until the parent explicitly enables
# it. The default upstream is Cloudflare for Families; `dns upstream auto`
# hands lookups to the network's own servers.
#
# Enter through the root-owned control helper. It clears the environment
# and serializes feature operations before invoking this file.

denylist  Everything resolves except the domains in the deny list.
allowlist Nothing resolves except the allow list and the short system list
          the machine needs for updates and time; a denied name still wins.
allow, deny, remove
          Move domains between /etc/omarchy-parent-addons/dns.allow and dns.deny;
          apply picks up a hand edit of those files. A site is many domains:
          log shows the names a page asked for and was refused, most often
          first, so you can allow them. An entry with a path, such as
          youtube.com/shorts, is refused (or allowed) by the browser instead
          of the resolver, which cannot see paths: Chromium and Firefox
          honor it by policy, under either mode. Whole-domain denials are
          also sent to those browsers. Quit and reopen the browser after
          policy changes; already loaded pages are not closed automatically.
history   The sites the laptop asked for in the last DAYS days (default 1),
          most often first, with when each was last seen: the resolver logs
          every lookup to the journal, which the kid cannot read or clear.
          Sites, not pages. Tell your kid the log is there.
upstream  Who answers for allowed names: family (default), Cloudflare for
          Families, which also drops malware and adult sites, or auto, the
          machine's own DNS servers. A sign-in page that blocks outside DNS
          needs auto until the parent is signed in.
apply     Reapply existing settings. An off filter stays off.
